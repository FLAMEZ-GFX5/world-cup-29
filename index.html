      <h2 class="card-title">INDIA LIFTING THE TROPHY</h2>
      <p class="card-text">INDIA ARE T20 WORLD CHAMPIONS AFTER 17 YEARS! It's been a long, long wait for India and they now join West Indies and England as the only three teams to have won the Men's T20 World Cup two times. You really couldn't ask for more, what a grand finale we have had here in Barbados and both sides gave it their all! The Indian players are up in ecstasy and the playing field is flooded by the dugout. The crowd is at the top of its lungs and it's another heartbreak for South Africa, they simply couldn't get it done. Rohit Sharma is down in tears, as he was after the 2023 World Cup final - but this time, these are tears of joy. You really have to hand it to the Indian side, they were down and out but what redemption this is for the Men in Blue.</p>

      <p> a touching gesture to commemorate their achievement, Kohli and Rohit posed together, cradling the T20 World Cup trophy against the backdrop of the Indian flag. Reflecting on the moment, Kohli explained his decision to offer Rohit a moment with the trophy, allowing younger teammates to savor the victory. "It was a very special thing for him [Rohit] as well. His family is here, Samaira [Rohit's daughter] was on his shoulder. But I just felt like in the victory lap he was behind the whole time. I told him, you also hold the trophy for a while, for two minutes. We should take a picture together because this journey has been very long," Virat Kohli said in a video shared by Star Sports.
